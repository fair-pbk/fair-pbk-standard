The FAIR PBK standard is proposed as a harmonized framework for publishing PBK model implementations or model code. It is, however, not a complete specification for all aspects of FAIR as it focuses mainly on interoperability and reusability. Instead, it can be included as part of a broader FAIR specification (or FAIR implementation profile). The table below provides a proposal for such a FAIR specification and shows how the FAIR PBK standard contributes to implementation of the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
